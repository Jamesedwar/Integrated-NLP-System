# Integrated-NLP-System
Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems involve Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Dialogue Management (DM) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). The purpose of this work
involves integrating learning with examples and rule-based processing to design an NLP system. The design involves a three-stage processing framework, which combines syntactic generation, semantic extraction and a strong rule-based control. The syntactic generator generates syntax by aligning sentences with Part-of-Speech (POS) tags limited by the number of words in the lexicon. The semantic extractor extracts meaningful keywords from the queries raised. The above two modules are controlled by generalized rules by the rule-based controller module. The system is evaluated under different domains. The results reveal that the accuracy of the system is 92.33% on an average. The design process is simple, and the processing time is 2.12 seconds, which is minimal compared to similar statistical models. The performance of an NLP tool in a certain task can be estimated by the quality of its predictions on the classification of unseen data. The results reveal similar performance with existing systems indicating the possibility of usage for similar tasks.
The system supports a vocabulary of about 700 words and can be used as an NLP module in a spoken dialogue system for various domains or task areas.
